## Hi, I'm Gabriel Pereira Andrade 👋

I've been enjoying web development since my first big project, which was also my graduation project 🎓, a [remote urban lighting management system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avbJtlRiH998c_5EA7h4YtjeRuejCCXV/view?usp=sharing), developed using JavaScript, Angular and MongoDB.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an e-commerce ([Vessel Group](https://www.grupovessel.com) and [Vessel Store](https://loja.grupovessel.com)) as a backend developer, using TypeScript and Firebase
- 🌱 I’m also learning Python from the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) carrer path in my spare time
- 🖥️ And I'm looking for a backend development role, ideally writing in TypeScript or Python. If you're hiring, let's chat!
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a kid I wanted to be a math teacher, but then I discovered programming and it all went wrong
