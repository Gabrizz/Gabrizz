## Hi there 👋

I'm Gabriel Pereira Andrade, and I've been enjoying web development since my college graduation project, an Urban lighting remote management system, developed using javascript, angular and mongodb.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an e-commerce ([Vessel Group](https://www.grupovessel.com) and [Vessel Store](https://loja.grupovessel.com)) as a backend developer, using TypeScript and Firebase tools
- 🌱 I’m also learning Python from the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend) carrer path in my spare time
- 🖥️ And I'm looking for a backend development role, ideally writing in TypeScript or Python. If you're hiring, let's chat!

- ⚡ Fun fact: As a kid I wanted to be a math teacher, but then I discovered programming and it all went wrong
